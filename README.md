# rust_strawpuller
A silly CLI tool that picks a random element of a vector. Glorified dice roll so I can figure out what I want to do, out of a handful of options.

## TO DO
1 - Rewrite with crossterm to make portable
2 - Add exception for empty Vec<String>
3 - Make some sort of animation so that the RNG presents choice with a little more fanfare or something

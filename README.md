# rust_strawpuller
Prompts user input, loads input as string into a vector, and then uses rng to pick an element and print that element out.

Why, you may ask?

I wanted to practice Rust by making something trivial, and I wanted the ability to "roll a dice" to determine what I wanted to do out of
an assortment of options. 

## TO DO
1 - Rewrite with crossterm to make portable  


2 - Add exception for empty Vec<String>  


3 - Make some sort of animation so that the RNG presents choice with a little more fanfare or something
